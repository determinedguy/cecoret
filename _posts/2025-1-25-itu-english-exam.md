> This post is in English because I realized there is little to none information or resources regarding İTÜ Proficiency Examination. Let alone that test, some would be surprised that İTÜ obliges its incoming students to submit an English proficiency test result as a part of registration (I might talk about this later).

You can access general information [here](https://www.sis.itu.edu.tr/onkayitlar/english_exam/index_en.php).

You can check about the revised model [here](https://ydy.itu.edu.tr/en/programs/undergraduate-preparatory-program/proficiency-exam).

## Passing Score

Basically, it looks like this.

| Program                                                    | Minimum Score  |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Undergraduate                                              | 60 – 74 / 100  |
| Undergraduate (exempted from ING 100)                      | 75 – 100 / 100 |
| Non-Thesis Master’s Degree (2nd Education)                 | 55 / 100       |
| Master’s Degree (with Thesis / 1st education (non-thesis)) | 65 / 100       |

You can check the score information [here](https://www.sis.itu.edu.tr/EN/regulations/valid-english-tests-and-minimum-scores.php).

You can check the details of English courses for undergraduate programs [here](https://ydy.itu.edu.tr/en/programs/advanced-english).

It would be better to have a high score from the first shot because it will be beneficial if you want to do Erasmus; [look here](https://erasmus.itu.edu.tr/en/student-mobility-for-studies/ka131-program_countries/outgoing/application).

> As a minimum requirement for the foreign language score, students must meet the condition of a score of 65/100, which corresponds to the B1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

So, aim for 65 at least; or 75 for undergrads (geçmiş olsun).

## Registration Process

> pahalı yani.

Generally, the required documents are:

- İkamet Card
- Student Card
- Photo

You can only use pencil in the test.

I paid for 550 TL (about IDR 250.000 at the payment time) under the "İTÜ Yüksek Lisans Beklemeli Öğrenci (ITU Graduate Students Who Are Currently Suspended)" category.

You can check about the fee (*selamlar*) and the payment information [here](https://www.sis.itu.edu.tr/onkayitlar/english_exam/basvuru/index.php?islem=sinav_ucreti).

## Resources

Actually, İTÜ has written a book regarding this exam: [A Self-Study Book for ITU Proficiency Exam Candidates by Birol Çetinkaya](https://www.ituvakif.com.tr/proficiency-wizard-a-self-study-book-for-itu-proficiency-exam-candidates).

> Ama biz öğrenciyiz, fakiriz.

O zaman merak etme.

Just do [the newest sample exam](https://ydy.itu.edu.tr/docs/librariesprovider95/default-document-library/sample-exam.zip?sfvrsn=dd1e5654_0), don't bother with the older one since the exam format has been revised.

The most recent "leak" I could find is from the June 2023 session:

- [Session 1](https://www.scribd.com/document/712503292/ITU-SFL-2023-2024-MOCK-PROFICIENCY-SESSION-I-JUNE-2023-EXAM-2) [Backup](nanti)
- [Session 2](https://www.scribd.com/document/703597709/ITU-SFL-2023-2024-MOCK-PROFICIENCY-SESSION-II-JUNE-2023-EXAM-2) [Backup](nanti)

[Test Atölyesi](https://www.testatolyesi.com/) might works for you, but idk; just found out as well.

If you can understand Turkish (*Türkçe biliyor musun?*), you can watch [this YouTube playlist from Test Atölyesi](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2bn6xXECq8UMjqjBSCIvGYwLFknHhJ1I).
